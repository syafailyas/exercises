     * <h1>Java Programming Demo: Conditional</h1>
     *
     * <p>This demo is designed for the 3rd meeting on Java programming, focusing exclusively on IF-ELSE statements.
     * It provides a comprehensive overview of IF-ELSE usage, including basic, nested, and compound IF-ELSE statements.</p>
     *
     * <p>For demonstrations of other programming constructs such as loops (FOR, WHILE, DO-WHILE), please refer to the
     * corresponding files in this project. Each file is structured to be run independently, allowing for a focused exploration
     * of each topic.</p>
